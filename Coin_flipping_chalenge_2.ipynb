        "## Who sees 26 heads first: Alice vs Bob\n",
        "\n",
        "Continuing on with my journey with Alice and Bob coin flipping problems, I am back with a new brain teaser. Suppose that a 100 coins are flipped, marked 1 - 100. Alice and Bob simultaneously check one coin. Alice checks them like anyone would: $1,2,3,\\cdots$\n",
        "\n",
        "Bob chooses a different strategy: he checks the odd coins, then the even (so 1, 3, 5, …, 99, 2, 4, 6, …)\n",
        "\n",
        "Who is more likely to see 26 total heads first? This question might seem easy. One would guess that Alice, like always, would be the one to win. I thought that too, but that is not the case. While Alice does win ~20% of the time, compared to Bob, who wins ~14% of the time. There is a tie ~64% of the time! This seems really unusual, and I am determined to find out why!\n",
        "\n",
        "I got these results by running a simulation of 100 coin flips 10,000 times.\n",
        "\n",
        "The 100 coin flips were generated by the randint function in the Python random library. While I believe that the numbers generated by this library are not truly random, that could be a topic for discussion another day. If I had access to more resources, I would prefer to utilize cosmic radiation for randomness—after all, my passion lies in studying physics!\n",
        "\n",
        "I then created separate DataFrames for Alice and Bob, each representing their unique coin-checking sequences. The program meticulously tracks their progress as they search for heads. For each simulation, I check which case has 26 or greater heads.\n",
        "\n",
        "At first glance, Alice’s winning percentage might suggest that her straightforward approach gives her a clear edge. She checks the coins in a linear manner, going from 1 to 100. This strategy allows her to systematically count the heads as she progresses through the sequence of coins. The linear nature of her method is advantageous, as it aligns with the natural flow of counting, and each coin she checks has an equal chance of being heads.\n",
        "\n",
        "On the other hand, Bob’s strategy—checking the odd-numbered coins first before moving on to the even ones—does not yield the same level of success. Although Bob’s method may seem unconventional, it reflects a unique approach to the problem. However, his win rate is lower, indicating that by prioritizing odd coins, he might miss out on early opportunities to encounter heads. This slightly lower win rate illustrates the trade-off between the odd-even strategy and Alice’s more direct sequential checking.\n",
        "\n",
        "Perhaps the most fascinating aspect of the results is the high percentage of ties. A staggering 64% of the simulations resulted in both Alice and Bob reaching 26 heads at nearly the same time. This outcome challenges the notion that competitive scenarios typically yield a clear winner. Instead, it underscores the inherent randomness in coin flipping, where both players can experience similar streaks of heads and tails. The phenomenon of tying suggests that despite the differences in their checking strategies, the randomness of the coin flips plays a significant role in determining the outcome.\n",
        "\n",
        "The implications of these results extend beyond this specific problem. They emphasize the role of randomness in games of chance and the complexities of strategic decision-making. Even though Alice’s straightforward approach appears to provide a slight advantage, the high rate of ties indicates that luck plays a crucial role in these types of problems. Coin flips, being random events, can lead to unexpected outcomes, regardless of the strategies employed.\n",
        "\n",
        "Furthermore, the findings of this simulation can be applied to various real-world scenarios. In fields such as finance, gaming, and artificial intelligence, understanding the nuances of different strategies can inform better decision-making. For example, in risk management, the insight that two different approaches can yield similar outcomes emphasizes the importance of adapting strategies based on observed probabilities rather than relying solely on theoretical assumptions.\n",
        "\n",
        "This exploration of Alice and Bob’s coin-flipping contest opens the door to additional investigations. One could consider what happens when altering the number of coins or when Bob employs a different checking order. These variations could lead to new insights into the dynamics of competition in probability.\n",
        "\n",
        "It encourages a deeper appreciation for probability theory and the intricacies of decision-making in uncertain environments. Moving forward, I look forward to expanding on these concepts and exploring new avenues in the realm of probability and strategy."
